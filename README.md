# 1.DESCRIPTION 

 The Easy Food is an app which is useful for managing the human food resources in quantities from any households, hotels, restaurants, motels, or even small venture food shops. This app is designed to be used individually by a person where they can upload/sell or order their food for a reasonable amount or free of cost. Consumers can also select the quantities or the amount of food (e.g., measured in Kg) based on the item and price per measured quantity. 

# WHY THIS APP? 

 The planet that we live in has few sustainable resources and is limited in its quantities. We get healthy food from flora and fauna. But they are densely populated based on biodiverse regions as they need particular environmental conditions to survive. They also maintain ecological balance in food chain supply. We the end consumers of this chain should use these resources efficiently. But rather on the daily basis the amount of food we waste is equivalent to 1.6 billion tons considering the whole population on earth. Most of this waste is from food catering functions, Hotels, small restaurants that end up dumping the healthy food in to the bin at the end of the day. We are making Food Waste is as threating to health of our planet as plastic waste as it damages the soil life. The end producer of generating this much waste is Human Beings, being the top of the food chain, it is upon us to solve this issue to make our planet a beautiful place to live. 

  

 

 “If you can’t feed a hundred people, then feed just one.”. Mother Teresa.  

 This inspired us to do this food app as most poor people are finding very hard to get food and also resulting in death because of hunger in this kind of world. 

 

Heads up People! We found the solution to use the food resources efficiently using this app

###  
 # PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

 The app is written using below languages based on their functionality and purpose to aid rich interface and experience to the user. 

 

  # NODE.js  

  Cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine to get the response from UI. Also helpful in creating custom Application Programming Interface known as ‘API’s’. 

 

  # ORACLE MYSQL  

 For queries and searching the data in the user database and back-end computing. It also creates a data base for user after signing in to the app. 

 

   # KOTLIN  

 Because of its interoperability and cross-platform with many frameworks and JDK library. It runs at back-end to compile the code faster after user interacts with UI buttons or layouts. It also consists of “VOLLEY” library to call the API’s.  

 

XML – To design the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the app. 

    

 

## 3. SOFTWARE & IDE's

SOFTWARE & IDE’S 

 # VS CODE: 

 source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. We used this tool to make API’s using node.js. 

 

 # ANDROID STUDIO: 

 It is the official IDE for developing Android applications. Because of its vast features like visual layout editor, APK analyzer, fast emulator, Intelligent code editor, flexible build system, Real time profilers, and jetpack tool support makes developers easy to change the preferences based on their activity or application they want to create. This also includes KOTLIN plug-in type as in-built to Android Studio. 

 

 # XAMPP:  

 Consists of Apache HTTP server, Maria DB database and also used to perform local test server. 

 

 # MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE: 

 A visual database design tool that integrates SQL development, administration, database design, creation and maintenance into a single integrated development environment for the MySQL database system. We used this to host the server where we can upload API’s and can be called using VOLLEY library in Android Studio. 

## 4. API


 
 API – Application Program Interface.  

    Set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.  

    Middleware between user end and back end.  

    Can be called using just a browser.  

    Multi-platform development.  

 REST CURL SIMPLE REQUEST URL: http://localhost:8080/api/users/1  Method: POST Content-Type: application/json REQUEST.
